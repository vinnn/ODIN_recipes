    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tarte tatin is a tarte that can be served for dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g all-butter puff pastry</li>
        <li>plain flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>6 dessert apples</li>
        <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>85g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>crème fraîche</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll the pastry to a 3mm-thick round on a lightly floured surface and cut a 24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. Lightly prick all over with a fork, place on a baking sheet, then cover and freeze while preparing the apples.</li>

        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 mins to a dark amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced chilled butter.</li>

        <li>To assemble the tarte tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter.</li>

        <li>Bake in the oven for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top – it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 mins until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.</li>  
        
        <li>Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices. Serve with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
